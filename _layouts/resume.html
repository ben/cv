                        The opportunity to work with an energy startup was very attractive to me, and since I've never worked at a company in this stage of its history, I felt like I had to work here.

                    <p class="resume-item-copy">
                        I've found that being part of such a small team has some major advantages, among which is the ability to shape the culture and technological substrate. I'm helping to build the kind of company I want to work for.

                    <p class="resume-item-copy">
                        I've been working on all parts of the web-application stack, from hosting in Docker to data storage to API design to Ember-backed front-end work. I've also done some culture hacking with Hubot, which has resulted in some open-source plugins and giving <a href="http://ben.straub.cc/talks/robots">talks at conferences</a>.

                        This was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. GitHub had been on my I-need-to-work-here list since about 2009, and when I was offered a job, I jumped at it.

                    <p class="resume-item-copy">
                        This was where I found out what it is to be a part of the Internet in a real way. I traveled the world, speaking at conferences. I worked with my personal heroes. I learned what it was to help make a company. This was truly the big time.

                    <p class="resume-item-copy">
                        My main focus was <a href="http://libgit2.github.com">libgit2</a>, an implementation of git with a nice API and no dependencies on a UNIX environment. This led me to helping out with back-end systems, mainline git, and even the native clients (<a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop</a>). I helped run an open-source project, wrote its documentation, and found out how I work best.

                    In 2010, I suffered a major personal setback.  I needed a change of pace, new scenery, and different technology.  I traded in my Droid for an iPhone, moved to Portland, and took a job downtown.

                <p class="resume-item-copy">
                    Here I learned the importance of fearlessness.  The code had a decent set of unit tests, and I had my very own copy of Resharper. There was no marketing safety net when making customer-facing product decisions.  It was terrifying and thrilling.
                </p>
                <p class="resume-item-copy">
                    I worked on a system that helps people sell things on the Internet. Sellers tell my code what kinds of things they have, and my code lists those items on eBay and Amazon (and a dozen others), and <em>figures out what price they should be.</em>  I led the charge to modernize the UX on a six-year-old WinForms codebase, and educated the entire team on the best way to do it.

                    I decided I wanted to be in the Portland area.  Pickings were slim at the time, but when a position at <em>this</em> company came up, I had to take it.

                <p class="resume-item-copy">
                    It was here that I learned practicality and self-doubt.  The coolest technology doesn't always fit your project.  The most elegant code isn't necessarily the best.  You can't rewrite the entire system every two weeks.

                    I wrote drivers for USB/HID devices, and the connectors and services that make them sing.  Without the software I made, a tablet would be nothing but a fancy mousepad; with it, a user can kick some serious ass.  The system spans the chasm from kernel- to user-mode, from datastream processing to UI.  And it does it in 13 languages.

I've worked on production applications in C#, using both WPF for client-side apps and ASP.NET on the server. I've taught <a href="http://www.infiniteskills.com/training/porting-from-python-2-to-python-3.html">a course</a> on converting from Python 2 to Python 3.
