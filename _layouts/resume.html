                    The opportunity to work with a small, customer-focused startup at an early stage was very attractive to me, and since I've never worked at a company in this chapter of its history, I felt like I had to take this chance.

                <p class="resume-item-copy">
                    I've found that being part of such a small team has some major advantages, among which is the ability to shape the culture and technological substrate. I'm helping to build the kind of company I want to work for. Working on a software system at the beginning of its life gave me the opportunity to apply all the lessons I've learned from working on more mature applications.

                    I've been working on all parts of the web-application stack, from hosting in Docker to data storage to API design to Ember on the front end.

                    GitHub had been on my I-need-to-work-here list since about 2009, and when I was offered a job, I jumped at it. It was everything I had hoped for, and more.

                    This was where I found out what it is to be a citizen of the Internet in a real way. I traveled the world, speaking at conferences. I worked with my personal heroes. I learned what it was to help make a company. This was truly the big time.

                    My main focus was <a href="http://libgit2.github.com">libgit2</a>, an implementation of git with a nice API, and no dependencies on a UNIX environment. This led me to helping out with back-end systems, mainline git, and even the native clients (<a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop</a>). I helped run an open-source project, wrote its documentation, and found out how I work best.
